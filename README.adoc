== What you'll learn

Demo action test 16/07 15:24

You will learn how to use MicroProfile Health to report the health status of microservices and take
appropriate actions based on this report.

MicroProfile Health allows services to report their health, and it publishes the overall health status to a defined
endpoint. A service reports `UP` if it is available and reports `DOWN` if it is unavailable. MicroProfile Health reports
an individual service status at the endpoint and indicates the overall status as `UP` if all the services are `UP`. A service
orchestrator can then use the health statuses to make decisions.

A service checks its own health by performing necessary self-checks and then reports its overall status by
implementing the API provided by MicroProfile Health. A self-check can be a check on anything that the service needs, such
as a dependency, a successful connection to an endpoint, a system property, a database connection, or
the availability of required resources. MicroProfile offers checks for both liveness and readiness.

You will add liveness and readiness checks to the `system` and `inventory` services, which
are provided for you, and implement what is necessary to report health status by
using MicroProfile Health.

The `system` and `inventory` services can be found at the following URLs:

- http://localhost:9080/system/properties[http://localhost:9080/system/properties^]

- http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^]

Visit the http://localhost:9080/health[http://localhost:9080/health^] URL to see the
overall health status of the application, as well as the aggregated data of the liveness
and readiness checks. Two checks show the state of the `system` service, and the other two
checks show the state of the `inventory` service. As you might expect, both services are in the
`UP` state, and the overall health status of the application is in the `UP` state.

You can also access the `/health/ready` endpoint by visiting the http://localhost:9080/health/ready[http://localhost:9080/health/ready^]
URL to view the data from the readiness health checks. Similarly, access the `/health/live`
endpoint by visiting the http://localhost:9080/health/live[http://localhost:9080/health/live^]
URL to view the data from the liveness health checks.

A health report will be generated automatically for all services that enable MicroProfile Health. The
[hotspot=mpHealth]`mpHealth` feature has already been enabled for you in the [hotspot]`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`
file.

All services must provide an implementation of the `HealthCheck` interface, which will be used to
verify their health. MicroProfile Health offers health checks for both readiness and liveness.
A readiness check allows third-party services, such as Kubernetes, to determine whether a microservice
is ready to process requests. For example, a readiness check might check dependencies,
such as database connections. A liveness check allows third-party services to determine
whether a microservice is running. If the liveness check fails, the application can be
terminated. For example, a liveness check might fail if the application runs out of memory.

The [hotspot=Readiness file=0]`@Readiness` annotation indicates that this particular bean is a readiness health check procedure.
By pairing this annotation with the [hotspot=ApplicationScoped]`ApplicationScoped` context from the Contexts and
Dependency Injections API, the bean is discovered automatically when the http://localhost:9080/health[http://localhost:9080/health^]
endpoint receives a request.

The [hotspot=healthCheckResponse]`call()` method is used to return the health status of a particular service.
In this case, you are simply checking if the server name is [hotspot=defaultServer]`defaultServer` and
returning [hotspot=HealthCheckResponse-UP]`UP` if it is, and [hotspot=HealthCheckResponse-DOWN]`DOWN` otherwise.  
Overall, this is a very simple implementation of the [hotspot=healthCheckResponse]`call()`
method. In a real development environment, you would want to orchestrate much more meaningful
health checks.

The [hotspot=Liveness file=1]`@Liveness` annotation indicates that this is a liveness health check procedure.
In this case, you are checking the heap memory usage. If more than 90% of the maximum memory
is being used, a status of `DOWN` is returned.

This time, you are checking whether or not the service is in maintenance or if it's down.
For simplicity, the custom [hotspot=3 file=2]`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
MicroProfile Config property defined in the [hotspot file=2]`resources/CustomConfigSource.json`
file is used to indicate whether the service is in maintenance or not. This file was already
created for you. To check whether the service is down, make an HTTP GET request to
the `system` service and check the status that is returned by the response. You make a GET request
to the `system` service rather than the `inventory` service because the `inventory` service
depends on the `system` service. In other words, the `inventory` service doesn't work if
the `system` service is down. If the status is not 200, then the service is not running.
Based on these two factors, the [hotspot=isHealthy file=0]`isHealthy()` method returns whether
the `inventory` service is healthy.

If you are curious about the injected [hotspot=inventoryConfig file=0]`inventoryConfig` object or if
you want more information on MicroProfile Config, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[Configuring microservices^].

As with the `system` liveness check, you are checking the heap memory usage. If more
than 90% of the maximum memory is being used, a `DOWN` status is returned.

While the server is running, navigate to the http://localhost:9080/health[http://localhost:9080/health^] URL to find
the aggregated liveness and readiness health reports on the two services.

You can also navigate to the http://localhost:9080/health/ready[http://localhost:9080/health/ready^]
URL to view the readiness health report, or the http://localhost:9080/health/live[http://localhost:9080/health/live^]
URL to view the liveness health report.

Put the `inventory` service in maintenance by setting the [hotspot=3]`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
property to `true` in the [hotspot]`resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file. Because
this configuration file is picked up dynamically, simply refresh the http://localhost:9080/health[http://localhost:9080/health^]
URL to see that the state of the `inventory` service changed to `DOWN`. The
overall state of the application also changed to `DOWN` as a result. Go to the
http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems^] URL to verify that the `inventory` service is
indeed in maintenance. Set the [hotspot=3]`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
property back to `false` after you are done.

You will implement several test methods to validate the health of the `system` and `inventory` services.

include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/health/HealthIT.java[]

Let's break down the test cases:

- The [hotspot=testIfServicesAreUp file=0]`testIfServicesAreUp()` test case compares the generated health report
with the actual status of the services.
- The [hotspot=testReadiness file=0]`testReadiness()` test case compares the generated health report for the
readiness checks with the actual status of the services.
- The [hotspot=testLiveness file=0]`testLiveness()` test case compares the generated health report for the
liveness checks with the actual status of the services.
- The [hotspot=testIfInventoryServiceIsDown file=0]`testIfInventoryServiceIsDown()` test case puts the `inventory` service
in maintenance by setting the [hotspot=3 file=1]`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance`
property to `true` and comparing the generated health report with the actual status of
the services.

A few more tests were included to verify the basic functionality of the `system` and `inventory`
services. They can be found under the [hotspot file=2]`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryEndpointIT.java`
and [hotspot file=3]`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemEndpointIT.java` files.
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. These tests
run automatically as a part of the integration test suite.

To see whether the tests detect a failure, manually change the configuration of
[hotspot=3 file=1]`io_openliberty_guides_inventory_inMaintenance` from `false` to `true`
in the `resources/CustomConfigSource.json` file. Rerun the tests to see a test failure occur.
The test failure occurs because the initial status of the `inventory` service is `DOWN`.

You just learned how to add health checks to report the states of microservices by using
MicroProfile Health in Open Liberty. Then, you wrote tests to validate the generated
health report.

Feel free to try one of the related MicroProfile guides. They demonstrate additional
technologies that you can learn and expand on top of what you built here.
